                summary: "This book is a must-have for anyone serious about rendering in real time. With the announcement of new ray tracing APIs and hardware to support them, developers can easily create real-time applications with ray tracing as a core component. As ray tracing on the GPU becomes faster, it will play a more central role in real-time rendering. Ray Tracing Gems provides key building blocks for developers of games, architectural applications, visualizations, and more. Experts in rendering share their knowledge by explaining everything from nitty-gritty techniques that will improve any ray tracer to mastery of the new capabilities of current and future hardware.",

                summary: "Enormous research activities are going on in the last few decades on nanostructures of semiconductors as they find remarkable applications in gas sensor. Gas sensors play an important role in many aspects of technology, industry and domestic life. Gas sensors require the synthesis of the materials in nanocrystalline form with well-defined particles size distribution. Indeed, its noteworthy that both the conductivity and sensitivity of the gas sensors based on these materials are governed by the particles size/grain.",

                summary: "The book introduces the reader to the central areas of English linguistics. The main sections are: the English language and linguistics - sounds - meaning-carrying units - sentences: models of grammar - meaning - utterances - variation. Notably, the book is written from a foreign student's perspective of the English language, i.e. aspects relevant to foreign language teaching receive particular attention. A great deal of emphasis is put on the insights to be gained from the analysis of corpora, especially with respect to the idiomatic character of language (idiom principle, valency approach). In addition, the text offers basic facts about the history of the language and elaborates on the differences between British and American English.",
